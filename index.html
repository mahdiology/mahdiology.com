                            What do we believe in?
                        </h1>
                        <p>In the begining and the end, and during any part of our believe, we believe in and value logic, science and reason.</p>
                        <p>We disassociate ourself from double standardness, contradictions, or dogmatism.</p>
                        <p>Whenever we make mistakes or believe in the wrong thing we appreciate it if others correct us, and we take pride in saying we were wrong and correcting ourselves.</p>
                        <p>We believe the statements mentioned above should never ever change at the core of our believe.</p>
                        <p>We believe that there exists The singular source of all existance beyond space and time. (Allah)</p>
                        <p>We believe Allah is all powerful, all just and all merciful, therefore even if the entire universe is filled with darkness, eventually Allah will restore ultimate redemption and justice. </p>
                        <p>We believe Allah has one important rule: Never lose hope.</p>
                        <p>We believe he has sent divine leaders who teach humanity the way to redemption, but the divine leaders have always been persecuted by humanity.</p>
                        <p>We believe the divine leader of the time (Imam Mahdi) had no choice but to hide from humanity, until they realize they need him.</p>
                        <p>We believe that every time we hear his beatiful name we must send peace upon him and pray for the hastening of his reapearance</p>
                        <p>We believe the divine leader is the only entity in the universe who has the capacity and the pure heart to solve all the problems in the world and end all injustice.</p>
                        <p>We believe that every sad thing that happens in life is because the Imam is not in power, that's why we believe the moment that the Imam is taken away from humanity is the saddest moment in the universe.</p>
                        <p>We believe Imam Hussain peace be upon was innocently slaughtered by a cruel tryant ruller, Yazid, and we condemn the terrorists who injustly murdered the innocent Imam and his innocent family, children and companions which included helpless women, innocent children and even a baby.</p>
                        <p>We believe the event that Imam Hussain peace be upon and his few companions were brutally and unjustly brutally murdered by ruthless terrorists (Who did this in the name of Islam) was the darkest and most painful moment for humanity and the entire creation.</p>
                        <p>We believe that after this trajic event, Allah stopped sending a divine Imam who reaches calls out to people openly, because the evil and shamelessness in humanity had increased so much that they might have repeated what they did to Imam Hussain peace be upon.</p>
                        <p>We believe the next Imams started shifting towards a more and more quiter call towards the divine guidance to Allah.</p>
                        <p>We believe Imam Mahdi (peace be upon him and may Allah hasten his reapearance), is the last and final Imam, disapeared on the day of his own birthday, because of the ignorance of humanity.</p>
                        <p>We believe that anyone who believes in any of the divine books sent by Allah such as Torah and the gospel, know that Allah can make someone live an exceptionally long life, such as Prophet Noah (peace be upon) who live many decades miraculasly or Prophet Christ the Mesiah, who is still alive today but was sent to heaven.</p>
                        <p>We belive Christ the Messaiah (peace be upon) is born from a virgin mother, he is the word of Allah and a prophet, and he will return with the return of Imam Mahdi (peace be upon him and may Allah hasten his reapearance).</p>
                        <p>We believe Imam Mahdi (peace be upon him and may Allah hasten his reapearance) is living a long life since his occultation decades ago, similar to Prophet Noah(peace be upon), Hazrat Khizr (peace be upon) and Christ the messaiah (peace be upon), by the will of Allah.</p>
                        <p>We believe ever since his occultation humanity is left in the darkness but we still benefit from his hidden presence as the earth benefits from the light of the sun when it is behind the clouds.</p>
                        <p>We believe at his absence best we can do is to pray for his return, get to know him, act respectfully to make him happy, stay away from injustice and what makes him sad, raise awareness and build a community of those who share the love for Imam Mahdi (peace be upon him and may Allah hasten his reapearance).</p>
                        <p>We believe according to our scripture the highest of deeds and our most holy obligation is to obtain knowledge, preserve it, and share it.</p>
                        <p>We believe knowledge is required to live, to love and to leave a legacy.</p>
                        <p>We believe everyone deserves the basic human rights such as care, respect, food, shelter and safety. So that they have the minimum requirements to even have the possibility to think about global justice and obtaining knowledge. Just like we were bessed to have.</p>
                        <p>Therefore along our holy plan to obtain and share knowledge we strive to help people in need around the globe, feed the hungry, build shelters and make jobs.</p>
                        <p>We support freedom and equality for all, regardless of race, gender or religion. We strongly condomn sectarianism and injustice.</p>
                        <p>We pray to give allegiance to Imam Mahdi (peace be upon him and may Allah hasten his reapearance) when he returns, and nobody else.</p>
                        <p>Imam mahdi knows all languages, can do all miracles, and knows all things so it is easy to identify him from imposters, Alah willing.</p>
                        <p>We give allegiance to each other to help each other to sacrafice ourselves, our community and everything we have for Imam Mahdi (peace be upon him and may Allah hasten his reapearance) when the time comes and the Imam returns, Allah willing.</p>
